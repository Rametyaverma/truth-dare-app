                <h2>HOW TO PLAY THE TRUTH OR DARE GAME ONLINE?</h2>
                <p>
                    When it's a player's turn, they choose between answering a 'truth' question honestly or performing a
                    'dare.'
                    Other participants come up with a truth question or a dare task. These should be respectful and
                    within comfort
                    boundaries. If the player chooses 'truth,' they must answer the question honestly. If they choose
                    'dare,' they
                    must perform the task and often prove it by recording it or performing it live on the video call.
                </p>

                <h2>TRUTH OR DARE RULES</h2>
                <p>
                    On their turn, a player chooses between answering a 'truth' question or performing a 'dare.' If they
                    choose
                    'truth,' they must answer any question asked by the other players honestly. If they choose 'dare,'
                    they must
                    complete a task or challenge set by the other players.
                </p>

                <h2>TO PLAY THE TRUTH OR DARE ONLINE, FOLLOW THESE STEPS:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Gathering Players:</strong> The game starts with a group of people. There’s no maximum
                        number, but a group of 4–8 is typically more manageable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong> Players sit in a circle and determine the order in which
                        they will play. This can be decided randomly or in a circle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choosing Truth or Dare:</strong> On their turn, a player chooses between answering a
                        "truth" question or performing a "dare." If they choose "truth," they must answer any question
                        asked by the other players honestly. If they choose "dare," they must complete a task or
                        challenge set by the other players.</li>
                    <li><strong>Setting Limits:</strong> Before starting, it’s important to set some ground rules. The
                        questions and dares should be appropriate for the age and comfort level of all players. It’s
                        essential to establish what is off-limits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respecting Decisions:</strong> Players should feel comfortable and safe. They have the
                        right to skip a turn or drop out of the game if they feel uncomfortable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keeping it Fun:</strong> The aim of the game is to have fun and enjoy friendly bonding.
                        The questions and dares should not be used to embarrass or hurt anyone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Some versions of the game have consequences for players who
                        refuse to answer a truth or complete a dare. These consequences should be agreed upon by all
                        players before the game starts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ending the Game:</strong> The game continues until players decide to stop or when
                        everyone has had enough turns.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="reminder">
                    <strong>Remember</strong>, the spirit of the game is to have fun and share laughs, not to make
                    anyone feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. Consent and mutual respect are key to enjoying "Truth or
                    Dare."
